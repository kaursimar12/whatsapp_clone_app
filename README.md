# WhatsApp Clone (React Native)

This is a WhatsApp-inspired mobile application built with React Native, featuring a familiar user interface and essential functionalities. The app allows users to simulate a WhatsApp experience, including chatting, statuses, calls, settings and more. Authentication is enabled through Clerk, where users receive an OTP upon login. The app currently uses dummy data to simulate interactions, as it doesn’t connect to a backend server.

## Features

- **Authentication with OTP**: Users can log in with their phone number and an OTP sent via Clerk.
- **Chat Screen**: Displays a list of conversations, including sample messages, timestamps, and chat bubbles.
- **Status Screen**: Shows sample status updates.
- **Calls Screen**: Lists recent calls, with details like call time and type (missed, incoming, outgoing).
- **Settings**: Profile settings screen for user information.

> **Note**: This version uses sample data and does not support real-time messaging. A backend integration is required for full functionality.
